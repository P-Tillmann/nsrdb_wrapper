Welcome to nsrdb_wrapper's documentation!
=========================================

This project provides a simple interface to download data from 
The National Solar Radiation Database provided by NREL

The main advantage to use this library over the vanilla API are:
* Attributes can be provided as dictonary
* Different Endpoints have sensible default attributes
* The Datetime information is parsed to a pandas datetime column
* Zentih and Azimuth Angle can be addded as additinal columns of the dataframe
